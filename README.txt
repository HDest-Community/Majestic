### Notes
---
- The loadout codes are `maj` and `mjm` for the weapon and mag respectively.

### Mechanics
---
- The weapon requires both a battery and a drum to fire.
- Holding primary fire charges a shot. The higher the charge, the higher the projectile's velocity and explosion damage. Charging is not necessary and the gun can be quickfired in a pinch.
